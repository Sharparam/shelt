<h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Adam</h1>

<p>
  You may be more familiar with my online nickname: <strong>Sharparam</strong>.

  I enjoy programming, which I started doing as a kid in circa 2005, and have
  done professionally since 2017. I host most of my work at <a

  >.
</p>
<p>Other interests of mine include photography and playing the piano.</p>
