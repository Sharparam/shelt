# Shelt

A version of Sharparam's homepage using SvelteKit.

## Developing

Shelt uses `yarn` as package manager (but not in PnP/Zero-Install mode).

Once you've cloned Shelt and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of Shelt:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
